#+title: Notes and issues and plans for the Bench app

* Updates needed for BETTER IR development

** DONE Arabic search support

*** DONE Figure out Arabic indexing into ElasticSearch

- Determined that there is a built-in Arabic analyzer
- Investigated Farasa and MADAMIRA but integration looks to be quite challenging for both.

*** DONE Can we do Spacy extractions for facets?

- Spacy does not do Arabic.


** TODO Multiple search tabs (one for English, one for Arabic)

*** DONE make the search index a parameter setting
*** TODO make the facets specified at the search tab
    - Almost there, entity rendering in the card is the last thing.

** TODO Topic development template

   - The application should specify the template as a JS object and
     give it to the Topic editor's props.

** TODO Highlights for relevance, rather than checkboxes


* Improvements to the system

  ** Make the different app components (like a search tab on a collection, a topic writeup, a review pane) composable in a top-level App, easily.

  ** Retargetable search tab: just specify endpoint and collection, with optional facet fields

  ** Specify the writeup tab setup with a JSON template

  ** Each tab component should manage its own state and save/restore functionality
